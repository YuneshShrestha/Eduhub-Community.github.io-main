Round 1: Technical (1 – 1.5 hrs):

Introduction
Discussion about my past experience at Amdocs.
Questions on Web dev:
HTML:
What is Semantic HTML?
Give examples of semantic tags.
Some tags-related questions (Can’t recall)
CSS:
The interviewer gave me a layout and asked me to code it live, I did that with the help of flexbox.
Cross questions on flexbox, glad I practiced it from https://flexboxfroggy.com/
Questions on media queries.
Miscellaneous styling questions.
JavaScript:
Is JavaScript synchronous or asynchronous, explain with an example.
Working of event loop.
Flatten an N-dimensional array into a 1D array without using inbuilt functions.
Questions and discussion on Promises.
Discussion about debouncing concepts in JavaScript and its implementation.
The interviewer (Software Engineer) was really nice, I was so nervous but he asked me to have a glass of water and calm down. After this, I was able to give my interview in a much better way.

Round 2: Technical (1.5 hrs): It was taken by a Senior Technical Lead, which was a live coding round and some cross-questioning on the same.

Brief Introduction about me and my skills.
Basic React principles.
Live coding round:
Implement the bootstrap Tab component (responsive) with 3 or more tabs (Reference:https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navs-tabs/)
The selected tab must show the associated content with it when clicked, I was given 30 mins to implement it, I completed it within time with class-based components. The live coding round was really nice as the interviewer and me were discussing the code while creating the component and we came up with the solution.
Cross-questioning on the implemented code, based on performance and optimization.
Data Structure ques:
A question on graph ds, a tricky question based on my component. (Can’t recall it exactly)
The interview went pretty well, actually, it seemed more like a discussion.
