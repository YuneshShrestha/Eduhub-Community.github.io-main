# What is Hackathon???

Hackathon is the combination of the words hacking and marathon. In this context, hacking stands for the development of software or hardware solution and the 
marathon describes the format, like in how many days you have to complete the hacking or in how many hours. Ussally hackathon needs a spacious venue, atleast at
a time 200 and maximum goes to 500 and may be 1000 depending upon the organisation. In some cases, the hackathons can also take place completely online, as it 
happened now during the Corona outbreak 2020. The Goal of hackathon is to develop a solution for a given problem, the problem is given by the organizations only.
The participants are mostly computer programmers, business and marketing professionals, designers and domain experts. Together they form teams to tackle a 
challenge and usually the solution they develop needs to be created throughout the event, without prior preparation, and will then be presented in front of a judges.

I had recently participated in a hackathon last month in my college only, it was 12 hours hackathon, me and my team got second position in that hackathon and we got
a prize money of 3000 rupees and certificate. This was my first hackathon I attended. I want to share my experience of my first hackathon. 

## My Experiece...

My experience about my first hackathon...

I am from University of Engineering and Management Jaipur currently pursuing B.Tech in CSE currently in 3rd year. I attended my first hackathon which was 12 hours 
long in-person event in this year in my college only. The event was organised by the college itself and Eduhub Community, Devfolio and many more.

It was 14th September 2022, started from 9am, me and my team reached there half an hour earlier. Our registration is done and we got our participation identity card. 
After that we straight away moved to the center and took your seats. We are waiting that when will be the event will start, after some lectures, finally everyone is 
allotted to their respective rooms and the hackathon was started.

My team name was Stuck_In_Loop and with me my room-mate was there. In the beginning we were very energetic and concerned about our project. We are building an app 
that’s related to our everyday life related to our college. Actually we can say that we were working on a real life problems. Our project problem statement was 
organising your college routine, assignments and our daily life task. So, the app we were building I can say that that a organiser app. The technology we used were 
flutter.

After 2–3 hours our energy level is decreasing slowly, but still we were working on our project. At 1pm we had taken our lunch and again at 1:30 we started working. 
The environment was so cool and its looking like competitive. Each and Everyone is working very hard. At 4pm we had a small interview of your project in that basis 
top 30 teams will be selected.

And yes finally we got selected, and we may continue your project. It was very happy moment for us that from 150 teams we came in between 30. So our energy level 
got high enough and we pushed ourselves into the project tightly. Moreover we had build the user interface only, we didn’t connect to the database. At 8pm we 
completed our project and went for dinner. After half an hour we started building our presentation and that was every thing for a project. If anyone want to show 
case their idea of project in very common way then presentation is the most important thing. So from 9am to 9pm we worked a lot and college management provide us 
snacks and drinks in every two hours. That is very essential for work on. So, at-last around 9:45 pm everyone submitted their project and presentation and everyone 
had to present their ideas or project in the stage in-front of everyone. We were at 23rd and we presented our project around 12:30 am the next day. Freak that’s to 
long. So, our presentation went so good and I was presented the whole PPT and my friend accompanied me.

Now, the big moment, its time for result declaration…

According to college, 1st team will get 5000 cash prize, 2nd team will get 3000 cash prize and 3rd team will get 2000 cash prize.

So, first they announced about the 3rd position, one of the team member in the 3rd position was my room-mate so good to see that my room-mate got the third position. 
Now we lost our hope and taking to my room-mate congratulating him, and the judge announced the 2nd position Stuck_In_Loop, and literally after listening that I 
really got hanged.

So, this is the story of my first in-person hackathon and we succeed by securing second position…
