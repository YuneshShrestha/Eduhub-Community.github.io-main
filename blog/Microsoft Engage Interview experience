Microsoft intern Engage is a program for student engagement and mentorship that provides 1:1 support to selected students as they work on a project and an inside look at Microsoft’s culture and values.

In this article, I am going to share my experience with the recruitment process for the mentorship program.

Eligibility Criteria:

 > Students graduating in 2024 enrolled in a full-time engineering program bachelor’s, master’s, Integrated Dual Degree & related degrees
 > 6 CGPA and above
 
Selection Process:
It was a 3 step process to be a part of the engage program consisting of resume shortlisting, online test 1, and online test 2.

Resume Shortlisting :– In this round, you have to fill up a form(this year you had to apply in the MS career portal), If you fulfill the criteria, you will receive a link for Online test 1. I was able to clear this round. I would suggest, including 2-3 projects in your resume and coding profiles of any platform in a proper and structured way, as, there is a big competition in this round. 

Online Test 1: – Online Test 1 consisted of 10 MCQ questions to be solved in 30 minutes. There are multiple question sets and scores are normalized accordingly. The topics for the questions were Basic DSA – Stack, Queue, Trees(mainly traversal algorithms), Sorting, Binary Search, and Priority Queues. I was able to clear this round. My recommendation for this test is, don’t omit any questions answer all questions positively.

Online Test 2:– In this round, I was given 3 puzzle-type questions based on time complexity analysis. Had to provide a typed explanation for all 3 questions. I tried my level best but wasn’t able to clear this round. The topic for the questions is- Time Complexity.

This was all about the recruitment process for Microsoft Intern Engage Program 2022.
