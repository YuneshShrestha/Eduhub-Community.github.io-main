The principal components are vectors, but they are not chosen at random. The first principal component is computed so that it explains the greatest amount of variance in the original features. The second component is orthogonal to the first, and it explains the greatest amount of variance left after the first principal component. 

The original data can be represented as feature vectors. PCA allows us to go a step further and represent the data as linear combinations of principal components. Getting principal components is equivalent to a linear transformation of data from the feature1 x feature2 axis to a PCA1 x PCA2 axis.
