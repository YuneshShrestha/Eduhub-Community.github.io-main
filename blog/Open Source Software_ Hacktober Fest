October is a significant month for programming. It is a time which the community — as a whole — unites in celebration of Open-source Software. An open-source project is a repository of source code which is publicly released under a specific licensing agreement, allowing developers the opportunity to contribute. In 2014, the DigitalOcean platform organized the first ever month long event —Hacktober Fest — to help inspire people to get involved.
Supporting open-source projects is important in various ways. It could be a beneficial approach for new developers looking to participate and garner experience working on a live production. It’s also useful for companies to openly source their code base as a means of interaction among a global community to help solve current software issues and help improve upon quality of product.
 
Starting out will depend upon your level of ability but there are contributions available for all skillsets taking part. Regardless of mastery, your point of entry begins at Github. This is one of the more popular spaces where the open- source community congregates. It also houses millions of open-source code including the repositories available for developers to contribute.
