A general-purpose, procedural, middle-level language (as it supports both low-level and high-level functionalities) that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to foster the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs, C was initially first carried out on the DEC PDP-11 PC in the year 1972.
The programs that make up the operating system are what C programming was initially used for. The code produced in C is nearly as fast as the code written in assembly language, which was adopted as a system development language.
Some examples of the use of C language are- Operating Systems (UNIX Operating system and all UNIX applicationsLanguage Compilers (C Compiler), Assemblers, Text Editors, Print Spoolers, Network Drivers, Modern Programs, Databases, Language Interpreters, and Utilities.
To discover the wide scope of structured programming language, C programming and know how powerful it really is, let's dive into the advantages and disadvantages of it.
What are the advantages of C language?
C is a very popular language throughout the world and is ideal for a programmer to learn at the beginning of their career. There is little vocabulary to learn, the syntax is simple, and the modular structure of the language is easier to learn.
1. It is easy to understand
One of the main reasons why people choose C over other programming languages is its simplicity. C is a highly portable language as programs coded in it are far more fast and efficient. This makes learning C easier than any other programming language. You can easily grasp the concepts behind C because there aren't many keywords or symbols involved. In addition, you don't need to be an expert in computer science to get started with C programming. All you have to do is read through some tutorials online and start writing your own codes. Also, there are system-generated functions and user-defined functions in C Language.
2. Presence of many Libraries
C Language provides lots of built-in functions which consist of system-generated functions and user-defined functions. Many general functions can be used to develop a program, while the programmer can also create a function as per their requirements, which is called a user-generated/defined function, in C Compiler.
3. Easy to write
Another reason why C is so popular as an efficient language among programmers is that it allows them to create their own software without having to worry about syntax errors. If you're not familiar with coding, then using structured language C will help you develop better skills. With C, you'll find yourself creating more efficient and effective solutions compared to those created by other programming languages.
4. Low cost
If you want to build something from scratch, then C is definitely worth considering. Because of its simple structure, you won't spend too much time trying to figure out whether you've made a mistake or not when developing your program. And if you decide to hire someone else to complete the task, they would only charge you less money.
5. Fast execution speed
If you want to execute your application quickly, then C is probably the right choice for you. Since C uses fewer instructions, it executes faster than other programming languages such as Java, Ruby, PHP, etc.
6. Portable
Since C is based on ASCII characters, it works well across different platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, etc. Therefore, you can run your C programs anywhere regardless of where you live.
7. Easy debugging
Since C doesn't require complex statements like loops, conditionals, variables, functions, arrays, pointers, etc., you can debug your code easily. For example, if you encounter problems while executing your program, just press CTRL+D to stop the process immediately. Then, you can simply step back one line and continue working until you reach the problematic statement
