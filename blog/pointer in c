pointer. The size of the pointer depends on the architecture. However, in 32-bit architecture the size of a pointer is 2 byte.

Consider the following example to define a pointer which stores the address of an integer.

int n = 10;   
int* p = &n; // Variable p of type pointer is pointing to the address of the variable n of type integer.   
Declaring a pointer
The pointer in c language can be declared using * (asterisk symbol). It is also known as indirection pointer used to dereference a pointer.

int *a;//pointer to int  
char *c;//pointer to char

#include<stdio.h>  
int main(){  
int number=50;    
int *p;      
p=&number;//stores the address of number variable    
printf("Address of p variable is %x \n",p); // p contains the address of the number therefore printing p gives the address of number.     
printf("Value of p variable is %d \n",*p); // As we know that * is used to dereference a pointer therefore if we print *p, we will get the value stored at the address contained by p.    
return 0;  
}
