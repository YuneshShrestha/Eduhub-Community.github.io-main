What is the Community Blog:

Our Community Blog puts a different spin on our original blog page.  Instead of each community member creating a separate blog, all community members have the opportunity to contribute their very own blog posts to a single community blog. This provides greater benefit to both the bloggers and readers. 

What are the Benefits of the Community Blog:

Viewers can RSS the Community Blog by a specific blog post author
Many members contributing to a single blog attracts more viewers, increasing the readership for all bloggers
Blog contributors can give more time and attention to each blog post since no single blogger has to provide continuous content to keep the blog fresh
The Community Blog gives bloggers the opportunity to make a name and brand for themselves in the business analysis profession
